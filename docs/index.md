# acoupi_batdetect2

## What is acoupi_batdetect2?

*acoupi_batdetect2* is an open-source Python package that implement the  BatDetect2 [@macodhaÂ andÂ al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520490) bioacoustics DL model using the [**acoupi**](https://github.com/acoupi) framework. 

The *acoupi_batdetect2*  provides users with a pre-built _acoupi_ program that can be configured and tailored to their use cases of monitoring UK bats species.

## Requirements

*acoupi_batdetect2* has been designed to run on single-board computer devices like the [RaspberryÂ Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (RPi).
Users should be able to download and test *acoupi_batdetect2* software on any Linux-based machines with Python version >=3.8,<3.12 installed.

- A Linux-based single board computer such as the Raspberry Pi 4B.
- A SD Card with 64-bit Lite OS version installed.
- An ultrasonic USB Microphone such as an [AudioMothÂ USBÂ Microphone](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) or an Ultramic 192K/250K.


??? tip "Recommended Hardware"

    The software has been extensively developed and tested with the RPi 4B.
    We advise users to select the RPi 4B or a device featuring similar specifications.

## Installation

To install *acoupi_batdetect2* on your embedded device follow these steps:

!!! Example "Step1: Install *acoupi_batdetect2* and its dependencies"

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://github.com/acoupi/acoupi_batdetect2/raw/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
    ```

!!! Example "Step 2: Configure the *acoupi_batdetect2* program."

    ```bash
    acoupi setup --program acoupi_batdetect2.program
    ```

!!! Example "Step 3: Start the *acoupi_batdetect2* program."

    ```bash
    acoupi deployment start
    ```

??? tip "Using acoupi from the command line"

    To check what are the available commands for acoupi, enter `acoupi --help`. Also look at the [CLI documentation](reference/cli.md) for further info.

## What is the acoupi framework? ðŸš€

`acoupi` simplifies the use and implementation of open-source AI bioacoustics models.

??? warning "Licenses and Usage"

    Before using a pre-trained AI bioacoustic classifier, review its license to ensure it aligns with your intended use.
    `acoupi` programs built with these models inherit the corresponding model licenses.
    For further licensing details, refer to the [FAQ](faq.md#licensing) section.

??? warning "Model Output Reliability"

    Please note that `acoupi_batdetect2` is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of the model predictions.
    It is crucial to understand the performance and limitations of the model before using it in your project.

    To learn more about the BatDetect2 model architecture and its precision recall, read the publication [_Towards a General Approach for Bat Echolocation Detection and Classification_ by Oisin M.A., et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.14.520490).
